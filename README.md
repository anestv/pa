This project is currently in development.
Bugs and errors may occur frequently

- **Looking for where to start?**
Why not go to [index.php](index.php)

- **Looking for help?**
Contact me, but it is very possible I may not be able to reply. Alternatively, ask 
a question at the [PrivateAsk profile](http://privateask.noip.me/pa/user/privateask)

- **Want to contribute?**
Great! [This wiki page](https://github.com/anestv/pa/wiki/How-to-contribute) is for you! Currently 
there are no code style guidelines, so just be consistent with the rest of the file. 
If you find some functions that are not declared (such as `terminate()`) it's because 
they are declared in a prepeded file, which is not located in this repo.

- **Want to use it?**
I use XAMPP. The database configuration is located in this repo.
