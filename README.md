This project is currently in development.
Bugs and errors may occur frequently

- **Looking for where to start?**
Why not go to [index.php](index.php)

- **Looking for help?**
Contact me, but it is very possible I may not be able to reply

- **Want to contribute?**
Great! Feel free to report an issue, or comment on one you'd like to fix. Currently 
there are no code style guidelines, so just be consistent with the rest of the file. 
If you find some functions that are not declared (such as `terminate()`) it's because 
they are declared in a prepeded file, which is not located in this repo.

- **Want to use it?**
I use XAMPP. The PHP files are ready to go, but you will also need the database 
configuration which is not located in this repo.
