Under no circumstances are we liable for any damage resulted from using this website. Information on this website is provided to you “AS IS”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do not guarantee that this website will be functional or error-free, or that it will be suitable for a particular purpose. This website is currently in active development, meaning that many of its components and features are subject to change, not necessarily improving.</p>

<h2>2. Use and distribution of content from you</h2>
